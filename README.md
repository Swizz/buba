# buba
Bublé + a little bit of Babel for your esnext tests


## Why?
Because a wise man once said your source code should be transpiled with same tool as your tests to avoid any hidden bugs.

The primary transformer here is [Bublé](buble.surge.sh/#) we only use [Babel](babeljs.io) for support with module import/exports.
